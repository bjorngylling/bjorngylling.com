Welcome to Coding by .. well me! If all goes as planned (that is if I don't *forget* all about this) I'll be sharing my experiences with programming-related topics here. I'm a student at [Linköpings University](http://www.liu.se) in Sweden where I study programming. In the free-time I also fumble my way through [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) which I've grown very fond of after two courses of "regular" [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). In one course we wrote a *(very)* simple programming language, [Dunder](http://www.github.com/bjorngylling/TDP019 "Github project"). Compared to PHP, which I've also spent a lot of time on, Rails is **much** more pleasant to work with.

I've started this blog in time for my first Macbook Pro which will hopefully arrive any day now. I'll probably make a post about setting up a Ruby on Rails enviroment under OS X soon after my MBP arrives. I plan on documenting other interessting *(and maybe not so interessting)* things I bump into while getting used to OS X.
